Project: Predicting Airbnb Rental Prices in Las Vegas

To predict whether a Las Vegas Airbnb listing is high-priced or low-priced using listing-level features like location, room type, availability, and review behavior.
We built a binary classification model using Random Forest, evaluated different configurations, and achieved strong performance above 80% accuracy.
